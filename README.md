# My dotsfiles
This is just where I store my dotsfiles, feel free to see what I did,
and grab some part that interest you, or advise me on some tweaks I can make.

Please don't execute install.sh, it works with my setup and I know how to handle it,
I don't want anyone breaking their setups because of a stupid script I badly wrote

listMissingBin just test if my necessary binaries are installed
